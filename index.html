<p>Problem statement: Applications suck at correctly and consistently supporting proxy configuration.</p>

<p>Proxy configuration is problematic for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are a variety of places to get configuration information</li>
<li>There are a variety of proxy types</li>
<li>Proxy auto-configuration (PAC) requires Javascript (which most applications don't have)</li>
<li>Automatically determining PAC location requires an implementation of the WPAD protocol </li>
</ol>

<p>These issues make programming with support for proxies hard. Application developers only want to answer the question: Given a network resource, how do I reach it? Because this is their concern, most applications just give up and try to read the proxy from an environment variable. This is problematic because:</p>

<p>1 Given the increased use of mobile computing, network switching frequently occurs during the lifetime of an application
1 Each application is required to implement the (non-trivial) WPAD and PAC protocols, including a Javascript engine
1 It prevents a network administrator from locking down settings on a particular host or user
1   In most cases, the environmental variable is almost never correct by default </p>

<a id="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Solution</h1>

<p>libproxy exists to answer the question: Given a network resource, how do I reach it? It handles all the details, enabling you to get back to programming.</p>

<p>GNOME? KDE? Command line? WPAD? PAC? Network changed? It doesn't matter! Just ask libproxy what proxy to use: you get simple code and your users get correct, consistant behavior and broad infrastructure compatibility.
Why use libproxy?</p>
